======

Theory
-------

1. Convert the following decimal numbers into binary and hexidecimal:
    * 14
    * 63
    * 255
    * 300

2. Convert the following binary numbers into and decimal and hexidecimal:

    * 00101000
    * 10111010
    * 01100110

3. Add the following numbers in binary (show your working and carry-bits)

    * 00101000 + 10110010
    * 01101011 + 00110001
    * 10101011 + 10110001 (notice what happens).

4. Write the following hexidecimal as binary and as decimal:
  
   * 01
   * 0B
   * 66
   * C5
   * FF


Digital Circuits

Python 
-------


1. What are the types of the following (use the 'type()' function):
    * 6
    * 6+8
    * 3*2
    * 4.3
    * 6 + 4.3
    * [3,4,5]
    * [3,4,5] + [2,3]
    * "Hello"
    * "Hello" + " world"

2. Given the list of floats:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    heights = [1.82, 1.70, 1.68, 1.85, 1.78, 1.58]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    write a for-loop that 

        i. adds all the numbers up
        ii. finds the mean


3. Given a list that contains 8 '0's and '1's, for example:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    bits = [0,1,1,0, 0,0,1,0]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    write code that turns this into a decimal number and print it out.


4. (Harder) You can join 2 strings with '+', for example:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    mystring = "Hello" + " " + "world"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    given a list of strings

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    list_of_strs = ["Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta"]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    use a loop to turn this into a single string:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    "Alpha - Beta - Gamma - Delta"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Linux
-------

There are lots of excellent programs for linux. Try installing the
following (sudo apt-get install XX):

     inkscape
     chromium-browser
     frozen-bubble

Once they are installed, you can either run them from the commandline-or find
them on the start menu.
